Recently I‚Äôve been stacking up quite a few digital sketchbooks with experiments ranging from 3D to web audio to animations. Anything I‚Äôve been interested in tinkering with, with my ‚Äúsketchbooks‚Äù I have a place I can quickly come and iterate on ideas without boundaries.

I thought I‚Äôd briefly share my process creating the sketchbooks, how they work, and share a few cool examples of ‚Äúsketches‚Äù.

# Stacks of sketchbooks

I‚Äôve got a ‚Äúsketchbook‚Äù for each topic I‚Äôm interested in exploring.

- [2D graphics using p5.js](https://github.com/whoisryosuke/p5-experiments)
- [Web Audio](https://github.com/whoisryosuke/web-audio-playground)
- [3D using ThreeJS / R3F](https://github.com/whoisryosuke/3d-web-sketchbook)
- [Web](https://github.com/whoisryosuke/web-sketchbook-2025) (using ReactJS)
- [React Native (Expo)](https://github.com/whoisryosuke/expo-experiments)

Whenever I have an idea in one of these topics, I open up one of these projects and get started on it.

# My process

I‚Äôve tried to make the process as streamlined as possible so I can get in and start working on ideas instead of spinning wheels doing file or project management.

So here‚Äôs my process for starting a new sketch in my ‚Äúsketchbook‚Äù:

1. Get an idea
2. Open up the corresponding sketchbook project in VSCode
3. Run `yarn sketch:new CoolNewExperimentR1`
4. Start noodling in `/src/sketch/CoolNewExperimentR1.tsx`
5. Preview my sketch on web at `localhost:4200/sketches/my-cool-experiment-r1`
6. Create another ‚Äúround‚Äù of sketching `yarn sketch:new CoolNewExperimentR2`
7. Copy over any relevant code.
8. Rinse repeat

This flow has been working pretty well for me. I usually challenge myself to work for 20-30 mins max at a time in short sprints, so the ability to pick up one of these ‚Äúsketchbooks‚Äù and start ‚Äúdoodling‚Äù with code is essential.

To make it a bit faster, I created an app launcher called Entourage. I added all my sketchbooks so I can quickly click one and open VSCode with the project ready.

# Sketchbook Structure

With the p5.js sketchbook I made a nice little architecture for myself to simplify starting up new ideas. Then afterwards, each sketchbook I created was forked from that project.

## `yarn sketch:new`

I used to open up one of the sketchbook projects, create a new branch, and go from there. And all my experiments were sorted into git branches. This works great, but I wanted to be able to see all my experiments at once and share code between them if needed.

Now, I open up the sketchbook and I run `yarn sketch:new MyIdeaName` and it scaffolds a new ‚Äúsketchbook page‚Äù for me to work on. It uses a simple NodeJS CLI script I wrote.

It literally generates a new page in the router, so I can go to `localhost:4200/sketches/my-idea-name` and see my sketch.

It also copies a template for a ‚Äúhello world‚Äù React component for whatever sketchbook I‚Äôm using. In the p5.js project, it generates a `SketchComponent` that has an instance of `p5` spun up with sample code.

The CLI script also accepts a template parameter, so I can use a different template for my new sketch. In the p5 project for example, I have a template for offscreen rendering that has all the logic for spinning up an offscreen canvas. All the templates are [stored in a top level](https://github.com/whoisryosuke/p5-experiments/tree/815c872a667064c637f16491d7a83f85872cd86a/templates) `/templates` folder.

The script itself isn‚Äôt too wild ‚Äî it does exactly what we need: copies a few templates, replaces a few placeholders, and creates new files on disk.

```tsx
const { readFileSync, copyFileSync, writeFileSync, existsSync } = require("fs");
const path = require("path");

const TEMPLATES = {
  sketch: "SketchTemplate",
  offscreen: "OffscreenTemplate",
  "render-video": "RenderImageSequenceTemplate",
};

function convertToSlug(componentName) {
  return (
    componentName
      .replace(/([a-z])([A-Z])/g, "$1-$2") // Convert camelCase to kebab-case
      // .replace(/[^a-z0-9-]+/g, "-") // Remove special characters
      .toLowerCase()
  );
}

function findAndReplaceInFile(sourceFilePath, replaceSearch, replaceTerm) {
  var data = readFileSync(sourceFilePath, "utf-8");

  var newValue = data.replaceAll(replaceSearch, replaceTerm);

  writeFileSync(sourceFilePath, newValue, "utf-8");
}

const generateSketch = async () => {
  if (process.argv.length < 3)
    throw new Error(
      "Please provide a name for a new React component for sketching (e.g. 'SketchExample')"
    );

  const sketchName = process.argv[2];
  let template = process.argv[3];
  if (!template) template = "sketch";

  console.log(`‚öôÔ∏è Creating a new sketch called <${sketchName} />`);

  // Get template for component and copy it
  const templateFilename = TEMPLATES[template];
  const componentTemplatePath = path.join(
    __dirname,
    "../templates",
    `${templateFilename}.tsx`
  );
  const componentDestinationPath = path.join(
    __dirname,
    "../src/experiments/",
    `${sketchName}.tsx`
  );
  const componentFileExists = existsSync(componentDestinationPath);
  if (componentFileExists) {
    console.error(
      "Component already exists! Try picking another name or deleting the old file."
    );
    return;
  }
  copyFileSync(componentTemplatePath, componentDestinationPath);

  // Swap out placeholder name
  findAndReplaceInFile(
    componentDestinationPath,
    "ExampleComponent",
    sketchName
  );

  // Get template for page and copy it
  const pageTemplatePath = path.join(__dirname, "../templates", "page.tsx");
  const pageName = convertToSlug(sketchName);
  const pageDestinationPath = path.join(
    __dirname,
    "../src/pages/experiments/",
    `${pageName}.tsx`
  );
  copyFileSync(pageTemplatePath, pageDestinationPath);

  // Swap out placeholder name
  findAndReplaceInFile(pageDestinationPath, "ExampleComponent", sketchName);

  // Done!
  console.log("Done! ü§ò");
  console.log(`Created new sketch component: ${componentDestinationPath}`);
  console.log(`Created new sketch page: ${pageDestinationPath}`);
  const url = `http://localhost:3000/experiments/${pageName}`;
  console.log(`Live preview: ${url}`);
};

generateSketch();
```

This is nice and extensible for each project. I just provide a solid default template for a ‚Äúsketch‚Äù, a page component (usually just NextJS filler code), and I‚Äôm good to go.

I‚Äôm able to run this using `yarn sketch:new` by adding the `.js` script to the scripts section of my `package.json`:

```tsx
"scripts": {
  "sketch:new": "node scripts/generate-sketch.js"
},
```

## Index Page

One of the key things I wanted with the sketchbook was the ability to browse any sketch I‚Äôd like - without having to switch git branches.

Using NextJS and their `getStaticProps` API, I was able to fetch all the sketch pages using the NodeJS filesystem API. Since I generate a static page for each route inside a `/pages/sketches/` folder, I just have to check for all files inside there.

```tsx
import { readdirSync } from "fs";
import path from "path";

export async function getStaticProps() {
  const experimentPath = path.join("./src/pages/sketches");
  const experimentPages = readdirSync(experimentPath);
  const pages = experimentPages.map((page) => page.replace(".tsx", ""));

  return {
    props: {
      title: "",
      pages,
    },
  };
}
```

And since the filenames match the URL slug, it doesn‚Äôt take much work to link to them.

```tsx
import { Head } from "next/document";
import Link from "next/link";
import path from "path";

type Props = {
  pages: string[];
};

export default function Page({ pages }: Props) {
  return (
    <>
      <div style={{ padding: "3rem" }}>
        <h1>Sketches</h1>
        <ul>
          {pages.map((page) => (
            <li key={page}>
              <Link href={`/sketches/${page}`}>{page.replace("-", " ")}</Link>
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      </div>
    </>
  );
}
```

And it doesn‚Äôt look too fancy (yet), but it gets the job done.

## Page wrappers

Since I was displaying all the sketches in one place, I wanted the be able to control the uniformity of their layout from a single place.

With each sketchbook I tend to create a ‚Äúpage wrapper‚Äù type component that wraps each sketch. It could be used to apply a nice frame around the page with the sketch information ‚Äî or just apply the sketch name to the `<title>` in the meta tags.

Here‚Äôs the wrapper I use for the 3D sketchbook, it just displays the name of the current sketch in the page title.

```tsx
import Head from "next/head";
import { PropsWithChildren } from "react";

type Props = {
  title: string;
};

export default function SketchPage({
  title,
  children,
}: PropsWithChildren<Props>) {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>{title && `${title} - `}Ryo's 3D Web Sketchbook</title>
      </Head>
      <div style={{ position: "fixed", inset: 0 }}>{children}</div>
    </>
  );
}
```

# The top sketches

Here are a few standout sketches I‚Äôve put together this year.

## Circular MIDI Tracks

![A MIDI track visualized as multiple circular tracks for each note with rounded blocks traveling along each](MidiCirclePlayerR6-202544-908_-_Copy.png)

This one was pretty fun, it‚Äôs from the p5.js sketchbook. It takes a MIDI file, generates a circle ‚Äútrack‚Äù for each note that gets played, and animates line segments representing each note around the circle track. It

## Audio Waveform ‚ÄúSlices‚Äù

![Rectangles stacked side by side with the top line shapes like a waveform](Screenshot_2025-06-09_162034.png)

This is from the p5.js sketchbook. I play pre-recorded audio of me playing piano I created using Ableton Live and Arturia synths. Then I sample the waveform data at regular intervals to create ‚Äúslices of audio waves. It‚Äôs a bit slow, but it could be optimized in a few clever ways (if I had more time).

## ADSR Envelope with Visualizer

![A web app with an ADSR curve and waveform visualized on canvas, and buttons below with piano note keys](Screenshot_2025-06-11_142652.png)

Recently in the web audio sketchbook I got a ADSR (attack, delay, sustain, release) envelope setup on a sampler (e.g. plays 1 sound at different ‚Äúpitches‚Äù aka piano keys).

And to better understand the effect of the envelope on the audio output, I created a visualization of the ADSR properties mapped on a line graph.

## Frequency Tunnel Viz

![A web app with a black background and blue particles floating in space gathered in a sphere shape and exploding outwards based on keypress](vlcsnap-2025-06-16-17h45m15s308.png)

There‚Äôs definitely a trend of audio visualization here. This is in the 3D sketchbook. It takes audio waveform data and animates hundreds of particles based on the frequency - with a bit of extra math to make things look interesting.

You can check out [the source code here](https://github.com/whoisryosuke/3d-web-sketchbook/tree/3b4237ba6bc0706fc98eca548b8678947e8d7e15/src/sketches/WaveformBufferGeoR2).

# What‚Äôs left?

There‚Äôs 2 key areas missing from the template that would make it perfect for me.

The first, it needs another script for copying sketches. It should be able to take a sketch name and copy it to a new file (similar to the `new` process but using another sketch as the ‚Äútemplate‚Äù). Currently when I do iterations I tend to just create a new sketch and copy over anything I need.

The second, it needs a way to share code between other sketchbooks of similar types. When I need to do some audio work in my 3D sketchbook, it should be a simple `import` from a shared library that the audio sketchbook also uses.

This ones a little trickier to solve just practically. Technically it‚Äôs simple - I have to bite the bullet and just convert my sketchbook to a monorepo, add a shared library as a git submodule, and go from there. But practically ‚Äî does it just include all my utilities? Do I make submodules for each topic - and just import each sketchbook as a submodule? We‚Äôll find out.

# Get sketching!

Feel free to use my sketchbooks as the basis for your own. They‚Äôre all licensed with the ‚ÄúUNLICENSE‚Äù usually. Same with the ‚Äúsketches‚Äù really. So go wild.

If you make anything cool make sure to [tag me](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@whoisryosuke) on [socials](https://bsky.app/profile/whoisryosuke.bsky.social) so I can see it and share it with my circles.

Stay creative,
Ryo
